Self-Driving Car Nanodegree - Model Predictive Control (MPC) Project
====================================================================
====================================================================

In this document we describe the implementation of the MPC project for the course,
following the questions from the rubric (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/896/view).

Dockerfile
================
Before describing the implementation, it's worth noting the following scripts:

-`build.sh`. It will build the project using a Docker image based on the
present `Dockerfile`.

-`run.sh`. It will run the project from `build/mpc`.

This should allow reviewers to be able to build and run the project
even if they don't have the dependencies installed.

Rubric questions
================
Now we proceed to answer the questions from the rubric.

**1. Describe the model in detail.**
------------------------------------

The MPC approach consists on predicting the future trajectory of the vehicle
over a time horizon, given its initial state. A cost function over the horizon
is computed, and then passed to a non-linear optimizer that will find
the best overall trajectory fulfilling a number of constraints.

The model consists of the following:

-**Trajectory**. The model starts with the desired trajectory that the vehicle
should follow. It is represented as a third-order polynomial, in
**local vehicle coordinates**:

    f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d

-**State vector**. The state vector of the vehicle is a 6-dimensional vector:

    [x, y, psi, v, cte, epsi]

where:

  -x is the X position of the vehicle                       [m]
  -y is the Y position of the vehicle                       [m]
  -psi is the orientation of the vehicle                    [rad]
  -v is the velocity of the vehicle                         [m/s]
  -cte is the cross-track error = f(x) - y                  [m]
  -epsi is the orientation error = psi - atan(f'(x))        [rad]

-**Actuators**. The actuators of the vehicle are a 2-dimensional vector:

    [delta, acc]

where:

  -delta is the steering commands [rad]. Normalized to [-1, 1] before passing
   to the simulator.
  -acc is the accelerator/throttle commands.
   A positive value indicates acceleration, whereas a negative value means braking.

-**Update equations**. Finally, the model describes how the state of the vehicle
at times "t" evolves towards the state at the next time step, "t+1 = t + dt",
where "dt" is the time discretization interval. 
For this project we use the following kinematic vehicle model:

x_t+1 = x_t + v_t * cos(psi_t) * dt
y_t+1 = y_t + v_t * sin(psi_t) * dt
psi_t+1 = psi_t + (v_t/Lf) * delta_t * dt
v_t+1 = v_t + acc_t * dt
cte_t+1 = cte_t + v_t * sin(epsi_t) * dt             [*]
epsi_t+1 = epsi_t + (v_t/Lf) * delta_t * dt          [**]

[*] For a more accurate representation, we can substitute:
cte_t = f(x_t) - y_y

[**] For a more accurate representation, we can substitute:
epsi_t = psi_t - psi_des_t = psi_t - atan(f'(x_t))

-**MPC Horizon**. The horizon in an MPC problem is described as the time
in the future where we predict and optimize the vehicle trajectory.
It is defined by:

  -N. Number of steps. We choose N = 10 (see motivation later).
  -dt. Discretization time. We choose dt = 0.05 seconds (see motivation later).

-**Optimization problem**. In order to optimize for the overall vehicle
trajectory, we create a vector with N*6 + (N-1)*2 components, since
we have N*6 state variables and (N-1)*2 actuator commands.
The vector is packed as follows:

[x0 x1 ... xN, y0 y1 ... yN, ... delta0, ...deltaN-1, acc0, ... accN-1]

-**Cost function**
The model will optimize a cost value based on the complete state vector above.
The cost function is defined in Lines 181-205 of `src/optimizer.cpp`, including:

  -The sum for t = 0 ... N of cte_t^2
  -The sum for t = 0 ... N of epsi_t^2
  -The sum for t = 0 ... N of (v_t - ref_v)^2, where ref_v = 40 mph

This ensures the vehicle stays in the center of the road, well orientated
and keeping the target velocity.

  -The sum for t = 0 ... N-1 of delta_t^2
  -The sum for t = 0 ... N-1 of acc_t^2

This allows us to use actuators as less as possible - thus having lower
energy consumption.

  -The sum for t = 0 ... N-2 of 500*(delta_t+1 - delta_t)^2
  -The sum for t = 0 ... N-2 of (acc_t+1 - acc_t)^2

This ensures smooth actuator commands. We had to add a weight of 500 on the
steering command to avoid hard oscillations in the vehicle, keeping
smooth turns and trajectories.

-**Constrains**
The following constraints were possed in the optimization problem:
  -The initial state cannot change (it's the one given by the simulator)
  -The states at t > 0 must change according to the vehicle motion model
  described above.

-**Variables boundaries**
Finally, we must also set boundaries for the variables involved in the
complete vector passed to the optimizer:

  -State variables: can vary between std::numeric_limits<double>::lowest() and max()
  -Steering actuator: can vary between -degtoRad(25.0) and degToRad(25ยบ) [rad]
  -Accelerator actuator: can vary between -1.0 and 1.0 [m/s^2]

**2. Timestep length and elapsed duration (N and dt)**
------------------------------------------------------

**3. Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing**
-----------------------------------------------
The following preprocessing is applied before calling the MPC routine:

  -Transform velocity from mph to m/s [S.I.] - Line 74 in main.cpp
  -Transform waypoints from global to local vehicle coordinate system - Lines 82-86 in main.cpp:

```
    for (std::size_t i = 0U; i < ptsx.size(); ++i)
    {
        xvals[i] =  c * (ptsx[i] - px) + s * (ptsy[i] - py);
        yvals[i] = -s * (ptsx[i] - px) + c * (ptsy[i] - py);
    }
```

  where xvals and yvals are Eigen::VectorXd that we can pass to the polyfit() function.

  -Transform state vector into local vehicle coordinates - Lines 93-96:

```
     const double x_local = 0.0;
     const double y_local = 0.0;
     const double psi_local = 0.0;
```
     v is unchanged

  -We compute CTE and epsi to pass a 6-dimensional state vector to the MPC,
   as shown in Lines 97-103. The computations are simplified since we use
   local coordinates:

```
    const double cte_local = Tools::polyeval(trajectory, x_local);

    // epsi = psi - atan(f'(x)) where f is the trajectory
    // Since we evaluate at x_local = 0, the only remaining
    // term is trajectory[1]
    const double psi_traj = std::atan(trajectory[1]);
    const double epsi_local = psi_local - psi_traj;
```

  -We create the 6-dimensional state vector that we pass to the MPC routine
   in lines 106-107

```
    Eigen::VectorXd state(6);
    state << x_local, y_local, psi_local, v, cte_local, epsi_local;
```

**4. Model Predictive Control with Latency**
--------------------------------------------
The way we handle latency in this project is by modifying the motion model.
The effect of latency in the system is that the vehicle keeps moving
with the same actuators during the latency period (in this case, 100 ms),
and then new actuators are applied during this time.

Therefore, it makes sense to predict an optimal trajectory starting from a
**predicted state of the vehicle after 100 ms**.

This can be observed in Lines 237-243 of src/optimizer.cpp:

```
    // Predict current state 100 ms into the future to account for latency
    // Assumming constant the previous actuator commands
    const double latency = 0.1;  // [s]
    x_t   = x_t   + v_t * CppAD::cos(psi_t) * latency;
    y_t   = y_t   + v_t * CppAD::sin(psi_t) * latency;
    psi_t = psi_t + (v_t/Lf) * delta_t * latency;
    v_t   = v_t   + acc_t * latency;
```

As can be seen, we do **not** use the normal variables at time `t`,
such as x_t, y_t and so on, which are part of the complete state vector.

Instead, we take those varibles and predict the real ones after 100 ms.
Only after we perform this operation we apply the complete vehicle model.

The resulting effect is that, after every step in the horizon, the MPC
tries to optimize for a trajectory in which the commands don't arrive
to the vehicle until 100 ms after they have been sent.

This simple strategy completely removes the effect of latency - great
oscillations in the vehicle to the point that it went out of the road.
With this modification in the code, the vehicle can complete a lap
without any oscillation or problems, just as if there was no latency
at all!

**NOTE**: it is NOT enough to perform this latency prediction only
for t = 0, i.e. before sending the state to the MPC. Otherwise, the MPC
will optimize for a trajectory where all but the first state
are delayed, which is an incorrect assumption - there is latency
at **every** time step, and therefore it needs to be accounted for
inside the for loop over the N steps of the horizon.
