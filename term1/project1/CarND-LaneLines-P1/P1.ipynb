    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a series of individual images, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"raw-lines-example.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like after using the helper functions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a result that looks roughly like \"raw-lines-example.mp4\", you'll need to get creative and try to average and/or extrapolate the line segments you've detected to map out the full extent of the lane lines.  You can see an example of the result you're going for in the video \"P1_example.mp4\".  Ultimately, you would like to draw just one line for the left side of the lane, and one for the right.\n",

    "Congratulations on finding the lane lines!  As the final step in this project, we would like you to share your thoughts on your lane finding pipeline... specifically, how could you imagine making your algorithm better / more robust?  Where will your current algorithm be likely to fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Please add your thoughts below,  and if you're up for making your pipeline more robust, be sure to scroll down and check out the optional challenge video below!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "Here we have implemented a very simple algorithm to detect the lanemarkings in the road using standard image processing techniques, following the following pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the input image is preprocessed:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -Color space transformation from RGB to HSV. After that, only the V channel (value) is selected for further processing. By doing so, we extract information only about the illumination, making the implementation less sensitive to color differences. This way, the code worked perfectly both on white and yellow lines without any change.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -Gaussian blur. This reduces the noise in the image, in order to improve the edge detection step later on.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. After that, edges are extracted using the Canny edge detector. A region of interest is applied in order to remove non interesting lines. We assume that the vehicle is reasonably centered with respect to the lane.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, straight lines are detected using the Hough transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Finally, we create two sets of lines associated to the left and right lanemarkings, based on the slope of the lines. These sets are further averaged to create a single line (left and right). Finally, two single lines are drawn on the image, from the bottom of the image until the furthest detected point in the edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are a few aspects that could be improved or that can potentially make the algorithm fail:\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Curved lanemarkings**. Right now we are trying to fit the edge pixels to a linear model of the lanemarking. However this assumption does not hold for curved roads. The output from the Hough detector would be a piecewise-linear lanemarking. However we would need to be able to determine which sub-lines belong to the same lanemarking.\n",
    "A better approach would be to parametrice the lanemarking as a quadratic curve or a Bézier curve. This would however require extending the Hough space to more dimensions (one per extra parameter), which would exponentially increase the computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Light/road conditions**. It is likely that the code will perform worse under non-ideal lightning conditions. For example, with shadows or reflections on the road (e.g. with rain), which would make the edges be not so clear to the Canny detector.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Too many parameters**. The code is quite tailor-made for this application, with a lot of tuning parameters: region of interest (ROI), Canny and Hough parameters, etc. This makes the algorithm very sensitive to different inputs. It would be better if these paremeters could be learnt from a large amount of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-**Centered-vehicle assumption**. The region of interest (ROI) assumes that the vehicle is somewhat centered in the lane. This allows us to discard a big portion of the image and focus on extracting lines only where required. This provides a good performance but will make the algorithm fail if the vehicle is not well centered or if we are executing a lane change.\n"
