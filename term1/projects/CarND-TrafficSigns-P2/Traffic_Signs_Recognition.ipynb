    "* **RGB to grayscale conversion**. According to the paper, this results in a slightly better performance. In addition, this will make our network easier to train, since the input is a 32x32x1 image instead of 32x32x3. Besides, by examining the different signs to identify, we observe that there is sufficient information in the shape of the sign and its contents to rely on grayscale information. A different case would have been to classify between 'normal' signs and 'on-road work' signs, which are distinguished only by the background color in Europe (white/yellow).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Normalization**. We implement a min-max scaling in the same way as it was done in the TensorFlow lab, given the good performance obtained. Another approach would have been to make each test image of zero mean and unit variance, but this would have taken considerably more time. Considering that the dataset (after generating fake data) is relatively big, we opted for a computationally cheaper solution."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset splitting\n",
    "We start with two datasets: `X_train_preprocessed`, `y_train_preprocessed`. In order to evaluate the performance of the network while tweaking its hyperparameters we must not use `y_train_preprocessed`, since we would indirectly be overfitting to this data. Instead, we create a **validation set**, that we use for evaluating the performance of the network. It's also usually called _development set_. This set is a subset of the complete `X_train_preprocessed` set. We perform the splitting using the `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the following 3 datasets are used in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `X_train_final`: 90% of `X_train_preprocessed`\n",
    "* `X_dev_final`: 10% of `X_train_preprocessed`\n",
    "* `y_train_final`: `y_train_preprocessed` (unchanged)\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose a 10% split rate because we want to use as much data for training as possible. Given that the extended dataset is pretty big (around 400000 images), a 10% is already enough to have a reasonable certainty that the results are solid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fake data generation\n",
    "After training on the raw dataset, we observed that the network had a not good enough performance on the test set (around 87%). As some students pointed out in the forums, the main reason for this is insufficient training data. Therefore we generated an additional number of jittered versions of each image. This proves to be a very powerful solution against overfitting and provides robustness against affine transformations in the image. \n",
    "The fake dataset could have been extended by jittering the color, adding noise to the image, etc."

The documentation of AdapOptimizer suggests 0.001, but we found a smaller learning rate to provide slightly better results. It's already a fast optimizer, so it is better to step a bit slower and make sure the learning happens in a proper manner. \n",
